destructuring: copying an item, which then becomes independent of the original

let {PI} = Math;
PI; //3.14...

you can only destructure something that already exist on an object

let{pi} = Math;
pi; //undefined

PI === Math.PI; //true

PI = 1;

PI === Math.PI //false;

No connection between the desourced/destructured variable and the source obj
