Input:
Looks different in different browsers (corner and heights, widths...)

Checkbox:
Displays differently in diff browsers as well.

How to fix:
CSS
defining CSS rules can keep it consistent such as:

input{   (e.g. input[type=text]{...Apply CSS properties such as font, width, height...})
    width: 100%;
}

textarea {
    width: 100%;
}

select{
    width:100%;
}

button{
    width:100%;
}
