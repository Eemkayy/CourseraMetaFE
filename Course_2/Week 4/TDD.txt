Traditional:
Receive reqs
write code
test

TDD
receive reqs
write failing test
write code to make test pass
code passes test
improve workable code

We have to write code in a TDD way, first we write the test ITSELF

e.g.

test('returns true if statusOfKeys exists', function() {
    expect(statusOfKeys).toBeDefined()
})

fails, no statusofkeys defined

source: function statusOfKeys(){}
test confirms it exists, therefore passes. This looks like reverse engineering.
